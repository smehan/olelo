<p class="hanga3"><em>Let us rise and eat before the doubly-weighted ones arrive.</em></p>
<p class="hangb3">Let&#8217;s get going and eat before company comes. The people of Honokaneiki, in Kohala, were not noted for their hospitality.

As people passed his farm to go to the beach, he would utter this warning. After they had passed, he would run to the river, change into a shark, and swim under the water to the sea where he would catch and eat those he had warned. No one knew that it was Nanaue who was eating the people until someone pulled off the shoulder covering he always wore and discovered a shark&#8217;s mouth between his shoulder blades. After he was put to death the people were safe again.</p>
<p class="hang3" id="pro267"><span class="grey">267</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;E &#8216;au m&#257;lie i ke kai p&#257;pa&#8216;u, o pak&#299; ka wai a pula ka maka.</p>

<p class="hangb3">Hawaiians didn&#8217;t like to be questioned as to where they were going and <a id="page_35"></a>would sometimes give this answer. Pa&#8216;e was a <em>mo&#8216;o</em> woman who often assumed the form of a dog and went wherever she willed. One day, while disguised as a dog, she was caught by some men who didn&#8217;t know of her supernatural powers, and they roasted her. This roasted dog was to be a gift to their chief&#8217;s wife and was put in a calabash, covered with a carrying net, and carried up the <em>pali.</em> Just below the Nu&#8216;uanu Pali, the men saw a pretty woman sitting at the edge of a pool. She called, &#8220;Oh Pa&#8216;e, where are you going?&#8221; From out of the calabash leaped the dog, well and whole, who answered, &#8220;I am going with them to look over the best in their land.&#8221; The men fled in terror, leaving Pa&#8216;e behind with the other woman, who was a <em>mo&#8216;o</em> relative.</p>
