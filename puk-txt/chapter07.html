He sent Keaweaheulu to Ka&#8216;&#363; to invite Keouakuahu&#8216;ula to Kawaihae for a peace conference between them. Against the advice of his own high priest, Keouakuahu&#8216;ula went, taking his best warriors along with him. When outside of M&#257;hukona, he saw canoes come out of Kawaihae and realized that treachery awaited him. It was then that he uttered the words of this saying. His navigator pleaded with him to go back, but he refused. Arriving in Kawaihae, Keouakuahu&#8216;ula stepped off the canoe while uttering a chant in honor of Kamehameha. One of the latter&#8217;s war leaders stepped up from behind and killed him. All of his followers were slaughtered except for Kuakahela, who hid and later found his way home, where he wailed the sad story.</p>

<p class="hangb4">Refers to M&#257;n&#257;, Kaua&#8216;i. In ancient days there were five patches at Kolo, M&#257;n&#257;, in which deep water mound-planting was done for taro. As the plants grew, the rootlets were allowed to spread undisturbed because they helped to hold the soil together. When the rainy season came, the whole area was flooded as far as Kalamaihiki, and it took weeks for the water to subside. <a id="page_233"></a>The farmers built rafts of sticks and rushes, then dived into the water. They worked the bases of the taro mounds free and lifted them carefully, so as not to disturb the soil, to the rafts where they were secured. The weight of the mounds submerged the rafts but permitted the taro stalks to grow above water just as they did before the flood came. The rafts were tied together to form a large, floating field of taro.</p>

Here lived the commoners and here too, the excreta of the chiefs was secretly buried by the <em>kahu moka</em> (protector and keeper of the excreta). This was an important position, for if any of the excreta fell into the hands of an enemy, the chief might die through sorcery. On the left side of the valley lived the chiefs and their retainers.</p>
