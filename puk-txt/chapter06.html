<p class="hanga4"><em>You reach for the breadfruit away at the top and miss the one in front of you.</em></p>

One day, while playing billiards with the king, Kama&#8216;iopili purposely played very badly and exclaimed, <em>&#8220;I ke alo no ka &#8216;ulu, a hala,&#8221;</em> whenever he missed the cue ball <em>(&#8216;ulu).</em> This puzzled the king, and when the game was over, he asked a man who knew <a id="page_210"></a>all the old sayings what Kama&#8216;iopili had meant. The king was told that Kama&#8216;iopili was reminding him that others had been rewarded with good positions, but that the man right in front of him, Kama&#8216;iopili, had been forgotten.</p>

<p class="hangb4">A rude expression for the people of L&#257;na&#8216;i. Once, a L&#257;na&#8216;i chief was conquered in battle, and the conqueror offered him either humiliation or death. He was to choose between kissing his conqueror&#8217;s penis or receiving a death clout on the head with a club. He chose humiliation, and as he bent to kiss the penis, he lifted his face quickly in distaste. Hence this saying.
