As they were about to leave for Maui, a stranger asked permission to accompany them, and it was granted. Late that night one of the fishermen signaled to the other to toss the passenger overboard because he was doing nothing to help with the canoe. The passenger guessed what they were up to and cried, &#8220;Oh! I forgot my cowry sinkers at the canoe landing.&#8221; Cowry sinkers were valuable, so they turned about and returned to Kap&#257;kai. Upon landing, the passenger leaped ashore. When asked where the sinkers were, he pointed to two half-buried rocks nearby. The fishermen were disappointed (<em>hoka</em>) in not obtaining the coveted cowry sinkers. In another version the saying originated at the birth of Kamehameha I on a canoe. At the landing at Kap&#257;kai his mother pretended illness, which drew attention to herself and gave Nae&#8216;ole the opportunity to seize the newborn baby and flee with him into hiding.</p>
