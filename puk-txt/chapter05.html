His efforts were rewarded when he discovered where Lanik&#257;ula went to relieve himself. Kawelo made a hole in a sweet potato and filled it with his rival&#8217;s excrement. This he took back to L&#257;na&#8216;i and with it prayed his victim to death. When Lanik&#257;ula saw that his end was near, he asked his sons to suggest a burial place. He found each suggestion unsatisfactory except that of his youngest son. So Lanik&#257;ula was buried in a <em>kukui</em> grove near his home. In the grave were placed his personal belongings, which, by the power invested in them by a <em>kahuna</em>, would bring harm to anyone who disturbed the remains.
