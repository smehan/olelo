Not long after, leprosy broke out among the people of Puna. The first to contract it were taken to O&#8216;ahu and later sent on to Kalaupapa. Others died at home and were buried. When the last ones finally died, there was no one to bury them, and the pigs feasted on their bodies. Thus, justice was served.</p>
