# Language and source notes

## Source dictionaries


## Unicode and lettering
Ideally the character to use for ʻokina is 
U+02BB MODIFIER LETTER TURNED COMMA 
(so it's a letter as far as Unicode is concerned,
 meaning things like text selection will include it in a word). 
 For various reasons it often gets written as the ASCII 
 apostrophe U+0027 or ASCII grave/backtick character 
 U+0060, or U+2018 and not all fonts will have the proper symbol 
 for it.

## Alphabetical ordering
The historical dictionaries may use all
different orderings.

Modern usage will follow https://geoffrichards.co.uk/blog/2013/08/hawaiian-collation/
the order defined in Māmaka kaiao, published by the Hawaiian Lexicon Committee (Kōmike Huaʻōlelo)

Basic ordering is english alphabet, with a
macron (kahako) coming after same letter without the 
macron, and 'okina the last letter in the set.
